# 🚀 openshift-rhca-journey

This repository documents my practical journey toward becoming a **Red Hat Certified OpenShift Architect (RHCA)**, with a focus on hands-on labs, automation, scripting, and container platform mastery.

I’m currently working through a series of real-world projects and certification-aligned labs covering:

- Kubernetes (CKA)
- Linux Automation (RHCE)
- Red Hat OpenShift (EX280 and beyond)

---

## 📂 Current Focus: Week 1 – Kubernetes Cluster Architecture & Setup (CKA)

| ✅ Skill Area | Topics |
|--------------|--------|
| Cluster Design | Control plane vs worker roles, node requirements |
| Installation | `kubeadm init`, Flannel CNI, kubelet, static pods |
| Troubleshooting | `crictl`, `etcdctl`, metrics-server, kubelet services |
| Tools | Bash, tmux, YAML, kubectl autocompletion |

📸 Each lab includes screenshots, blog-style README, Bash helpers, and Zettelkasten notes for reinforcement.

## 🧠 Learning in Public

This repo showcases:
- **What I'm practicing** week by week
- **The tools I’m using** to master infrastructure automation
- **My writing and documentation style** as a future systems architect

Every script, config, and lab is written with clarity in mind — so others can follow, learn, and adapt.
